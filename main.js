/* 
April has sprung and it's time to do your taxes UK dwellers! We can't be bothered to do all the calculations each year so it's time to write a function that does it all for us.

Using the tax bandings below, write a function that takes in a number representing gross taxable income as an argument and returns the net income, after deducting tax owed, as a whole number, in a string, following the Â£ symbol.

Personal Allowance Up to Â£12,570 you pay 0% tax
Basic rate Â£12,571 to Â£50,270 you pay 20% tax
Higher rate Â£50,271 to Â£125,140 you pay 40% tax
Additional rate over Â£125,140 you pay 45% tax
As an example, if the gross total of 11000 is passed in as an argument, the function should return "Â£11000" since there is no tax to be paid on this amount.

If the gross total was 60000, the function should return "Â£48568", because the tax to pay between Â£0 and Â£12570 is Â£0, the tax to pay between Â£12571 and Â£50,270 is Â£7540 and the tax to pay between Â£50,271 and Â£60000 is Â£3892.

Also, if the gross income includes decimal numbers to represent pence, then the net income should be rounded UP to the nearest pound. For example, a net income of "Â£30646.23" should be returned as "Â£30647".

For simplicity's sake, we won't be calculating national insurance contributions.
