/* 
April has sprung and it's time to do your taxes UK dwellers!  We can't be bothered to do all the calculations each year so it's time to write a function that does it all for us.

Using the tax bandings below, write a function that takes in a gross total taxable income as an argument and returns what the net income is after deducting tax owed.

Personal Allowance	Up to Â£12,570	you pay 0% tax 
Basic rate	Â£12,571 to Â£50,270	    you pay 20% tax
Higher rate	Â£50,271 to Â£125,140	    you pay 40% tax
Additional rate	over Â£125,140	    you pay 45% tax

As an example, if the gross total was Â£11000, the function should return Â£11000 since there is no tax to be paid on this amount.

If the gross total was Â£60000, the function should return Â£48568, because the tax to pay between Â£0 and Â£12570 is Â£0, the tax to pay between Â£12571 and Â£50,270 is Â£7540 and the tax to pay between Â£50,271 and Â£60000 is Â£3892.
